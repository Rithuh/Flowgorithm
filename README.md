# Flowgorithm
Flowgorithm is a learning tool developed in C# for developing algorithms using flowcharts. 
Advantage of using this tool is that Flowgorithm supports conversion of a flowchart to a lot of popular programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Scala, PHP, to name a few.
However, flowgorithm has a number of limitations, making it not very usable for designing complex programs.

# About this repository
This repository contains flowgorithm programs on some Sequential Control Flow programs, Alternative (If ... Else) Control Flow programs, Iterative (For loop, While loop and do ... While loop) Control Flow programs, all written in the main function itself.
This also contains programs involving Functions, Recursions and Arrays. 

The flowgorithm titled 'Cricket Scorecard' employs all the above mentioned techniques, and simulates a cricket scorecard database where scorecards can be created, updated, viewed and deleted.
